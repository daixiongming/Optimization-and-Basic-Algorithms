An Overview of Coordinate Descent, Gradient Descent, K-means clustering, and the EM algorithm

For each of the examples in the .rmd, data is generated randomly along with the functions. The purpose of this is to demonstrate knowledge of how each of these computation methods work. Each way serves a different purpose from another.
